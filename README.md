## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [cuss][cuss] (sorry, not on GitHub yet), a
"coreutil" static site generator.

I mostly code in [Go][go], [shell][shell], and if I really have to,
JavaScript or TypeScript.

Nowadays, I'm learning [Jujutsu][jj], a VCS alternative to Git. Most
of my repos are now jj repos, colocated with git.

Reach me at [BlueSky][bsky]: [@zbr.lol][bsky-profile].
